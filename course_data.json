  "course_name": "Python for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "In this course, you will learn about the Python programming language in the context of mechanical and aerospace engineering. \n\nYou will start with the basics of Python, like variables, collections, and different types of loops. Once you have the basics out of the way, the real fun begins. You will learn how to: graph thrust available and thrust required, graph dynamic pressure during a rocket launch, and how to plot airfoil coordinates. \n\nTowards the end, you will get a strong overview of orbital parameters and learn how to model both 2D and 3D static orbits. Once youâ€™ve completed this course, you will have a better understanding of Python and how it works in the context of mechanical/aerospace engineering.",
